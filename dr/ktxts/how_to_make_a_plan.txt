How to make a plan

 First to make a plan you have to have professional knowledge in the subject you are planning. This can come from years of experience or having a degree, certification, credential or award in a related field. After comes the ability to follow through with a complete plan, allowing the reader to gain enough knowledge from you so that they can make a similar plan for someone else. Think a few viewers at first, then hundreds and more later. Plans should be easy to read yet complex enough that readers find something new each time they read it.

Plans should be like a mini magazine. It can be longer but your aim should be 15? pages or so. It should be worth the money you are charging for it. Plans should include pictures, diagrams, Venn- diagrams, pie charts etc.. Make it model your favorite book, magazine, newspaper etc.. Guard yourself from adding false information by verifying everything you include in your plan. The goal should be to teach the reader with enough information, so they do not message you for more help in the future. Plans should be made specific for the individual requesting it but keep a copy so it can be edited in the future in case another person requests it or you want to make it generalized for public viewing.
